This works great.
(It only works for @foreverfoundry.com emails because I set it to internal only)

index.html
function authenticate() sends for /auth-url in server.js


server.js 
oauth2Client uses CLIENT_ID CLIENT_SECRET & REDIRECT_URI which i set in google console console.cloud.google.com/apis.
In console.cloud.google.com/apis what you do is create a project.
For that project turn on Google Docs API.
Configure Oauth consent screen
Type: Web application
Authorized JavaScript origins: localhost:3000
Authorized redirect URIs: localhost:3000/oauth2callback

Copy the CLIENT_ID CLIENT_SECRET & REDIRECT_URI

that whole function returns to the index.html the url res.json({ url: authUrl });
sends the user to the url by doing this:  window.location.href = url;

That takes them to a google approval page.
Once they approve they are sent back to the REDIRECT_URI in this case localhost:3000/oauth2callback
And in the url they also have ?code=ABC123&scope=XYZ
We can then use the code to create a document 
title: 'Titl'
text: 'Hello world'
