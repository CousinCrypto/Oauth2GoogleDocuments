Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/ 

Create a new project. [Name + add Billing account]
In the top search bar search for “Google Docs API”.
Enable the Google Docs API - select the project you just created.
Click “OAuth consent screen” then “Get started”. [Name + add email + (Internal or External - depending on whether you have a company email yet)]
Click “Create OAuth client” then “OAuth client ID”

Type: Web application
Authorized JavaScript origins: localhost:3000
Authorized redirect URIs: localhost:3000/oauth2callback

Copy the CLIENT_ID CLIENT_SECRET & REDIRECT_URI

Paste the CLIENT_ID & CLIENT_SECRET into the .env file

IT SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET 

If testing you can run it locally with localhost:3000 
But when pushing to live you will need to change to your domain name.

Go to "Audience" and then add your email under "Test users"


To run: 
npm install googleapis dotenv path axios mongodb body-parser express
node server.js

What this code will do is create a website on http://localhost:3000
if you go there, click the button it will redirect you to a google authentication page.
Once you have accepted you will be redirected back to http://localhost:3000 and a new google doc will be created for you in your google drive.
